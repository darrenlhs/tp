/**
 * A list to store previously sent commands.
 * This command history works similarly to a conventional terminal's command history.
 * Commands can be added to the history using {@code add()}. The {@code CommandHistory} will keep track of the
 * current command using an internal pointer which can be moved around using {@code nextCommand()} and
 * {@code prevCommand()}. Recorded commands will be added to the end of the list,
 * and duplicate commands won't be added twice in a row.<br><br>
 *
 * Example usage:
 * <pre>
 * {@code
 * CommandHistory ch = new CommandHistory();
 * ch.add("first command");
 * ch.add("second command");
 *
 * String userDraft = "draft command"; // Assume the user is currently editing userDraft.
 * userDraft = ch.prevCommand(userDraft); // userDraft becomes "second command".
 * userDraft = ch.prevCommand(userDraft); // userDraft becomes "first command".
 * userDraft = ch.nextCommand(userDraft); // userDraft becomes "second command".
 * userDraft = ch.nextCommand(userDraft); // userDraft becomes "draft command".
 * }
