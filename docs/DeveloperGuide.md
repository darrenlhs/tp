### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of several parts such as `CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `MeetingListPanel`, and `StatusBarFooter`.

All these components, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class, which captures the common functionality shared by GUI components.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder.
For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component:

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* switches between different views (`PersonListPanel` and `MeetingListPanel`) based on user interaction.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on the `Model` component, as some `UI` component (like `MeetingItem`) needs to find the `Person` referred by a `ParticipantID`.

The `CommandHistory` component:

* keeps track of commands that the user have entered in the `CommandHistory`.
* allows the user to shift through their previously entered commands via `prevCommand()` and `nextCommand()`.
* Usage:
  1. Add commands into the history using `add()`. Internally, this also resets the index to point at the end of the list.
  2. Go to the previous command using `prevCommand()`. Note that the current draft needs to be passed in. This is because the `CommandHistory` keeps track of the user draft (the text that the user is currently editing). Internally, this method simply shifts the index to the previous command.
  3. Go to the next command using `nextCommand()`. The current draft needs to be passed in as well. Internally, this method simply shifts the index to the next command and returns the command at that position OR the draft if `index == list.size()`.
* Example usage:
  ```
  CommandHistory ch = new CommandHistory();
  
  // Assume the user has entered these two commands.
  ch.add("first command");
  ch.add("second command");
  
  // userDraft is the text in the CommandBox.
  String userDraft = "draft command";
  
  userDraft = ch.prevCommand(userDraft); // userDraft becomes "second command".
  userDraft = ch.prevCommand(userDraft); // userDraft becomes "first command".
  userDraft = ch.nextCommand(userDraft); // userDraft becomes "second command".
  userDraft = ch.nextCommand(userDraft); // userDraft becomes "draft command".
  ```

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</div>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`]([ModelClassDiagram.puml](diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.puml)https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" /> <img src="images/CloserModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object)
and all `Meeting` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueMeetingList` object).

* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.

* stores the currently 'selected' `Meeting` objects as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Meeting>`that can be 'observed'.

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.

* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

## Adding a person: `add`
The `add` command is used to insert a new person into the contacts list. The name field (`n/NAME`) must always be provided, while at least one contact detail—either phone (`p/PHONE`) or email (`e/EMAIL`)—is required. Tags (`t/TAG`) are optional.

Input processing is performed by `AddCommandParser`, which tokenizes the user input and ensures that the following conditions are met:

- Name is present
- At least one of phone or email is provided
- Required prefixes (e.g. `n/`, `p/`, `e/`, `t/`) are valid
- Preamble is empty
- All field values are valid

If any of these checks fail, a `ParseException` is thrown.

Once the input is successfully parsed, a `Person` object is instantiated. As part of its construction, a `PersonId` is generated automatically, ensuring that each person has a unique identifier.

When the command is executed, `AddCommand` invokes `Model#hasPerson(Person)` to determine if the person already exists in the contacts list. A duplicate is defined as a person with the same name, phone, and email as an existing entry.

- If a duplicate is detected, a `CommandException` is raised
- Otherwise, the person is added via `Model#addPerson(Person)` and a `CommandResult` is returned

The following sequence diagram illustrates the flow of parsing and execution for the `add` command.

### Glossary

* **Mainstream OS**: Windows, Linux, Unix, MacOS.

* **Contact**: A person stored in the contact list, representing an individual such as a friend, colleague, or acquaintance.

* **Participant**: A contact associated with a meeting. Participant cards can be seen under a meeting, representing the individuals involved in that meeting.

* **Tag**: A label assigned to a contact to categorize or organize them. Examples: `friends`, `cs`, `school`, `project`. A contact may have multiple tags.

* **Meeting**: An event scheduled in the application, which may involve zero or more contacts. Each meeting contains details such as a description and a date.

* **Contact List**: The collection of all contacts currently stored in the application.

* **Displayed Contact List**: The current filtered view of contacts shown to the user (e.g., after using `find` or `findtag`).

* **Meeting List**: The collection of all meetings stored in the application.

* **Displayed Meeting List**: The current filtered view of meetings shown to the user (e.g., after using `findmeeting`).

* **Index**: A number assigned to each item in a displayed list (contacts or meetings), used to reference that item in commands.

* **Prefix**: A marker used in commands to indicate a specific field (e.g., `n/`, `p/`, `e/`, `t/`, `d/`, `dt/`).

## Appendix: Effort

### Overview

This project required a moderate to high level of effort. Compared to AB3, which manages only a single entity type (Person), adding an additional entity type of Meetings
required us to design and integrate a new set of features while ensuring compatibility with the existing system.

### Extending the Architecture

One major challenge was implementing support for multiple entity types within a structure originally designed for only one. This included:
- Designing and implementing a new Meeting entity
- Extending the model, logic, and storage components to support meetings
- Creating a separate UI view for meetings and enabling seamless switching between Contacts and Meetings

### Entity Relationships

Another key challenge was creating references between entities, specifically linking contacts to meetings. Meetings can involve multiple contacts, which required us to:
- Store and manage references to existing Person objects within Meeting objects, and ensure it remains consistent when contacts are edited or deleted
- Adapt the storage layer so that these relationships can be saved and reconstructed accurately from JSON

### Understanding and Adapting AB3

A further difficulty was understanding and adapting the internal architecture of AB3. Much of the effort involved reverse-engineering how entities are handled across layers (Model, Logic, Storage), especially:
- How data is parsed and validated
- How commands interact with the model
- How data is persisted in JSON format

We had to replicate and adapt these mechanisms for the new Meeting entity, including modifying the JSON storage structure (`InternlinkData.json`) to support multiple entity types while maintaining data integrity.

### Conclusion

Overall, while AB3 provided a strong foundation, the effort required to extend it into a multi-entity system with additional UI functionality was considerable. As a team of four, we worked collaboratively to design, implement, and refine the application to the best of our abilities.
