### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2526S2-CS2103T-T12-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2526S2-CS2103T-T12-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### UI component

**API** : [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2526S2-CS2103T-T12-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of several parts such as `CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `MeetingListPanel`, and `StatusBarFooter`.

All these components, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class, which captures the common functionality shared by GUI components.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder.
For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2526S2-CS2103T-T12-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2526S2-CS2103T-T12-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml).

The `UI` component:

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* switches between different views (`PersonListPanel` and `MeetingListPanel`) based on user interaction.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on the `Model` component, as some `UI` component (like `MeetingItem`) needs to find the `Person` referred by a `ParticipantID`.

The `CommandHistory` component:

* keeps track of commands that the user have entered in the `CommandHistory`.
* allows the user to shift through their previously entered commands via `prevCommand()` and `nextCommand()`.
* Usage:
  1. Add commands into the history using `add()`. Internally, this also resets the index to point at the end of the list.
  2. Go to the previous command using `prevCommand()`. Note that the current draft needs to be passed in. This is because the `CommandHistory` keeps track of the user draft (the text that the user is currently editing). Internally, this method simply shifts the index to the previous command.
  3. Go to the next command using `nextCommand()`. The current draft needs to be passed in as well. Internally, this method simply shifts the index to the next command and returns the command at that position OR the draft if `index == list.size()`.
* Example usage:
  ```
  CommandHistory ch = new CommandHistory();

  // Assume the user has entered these two commands.
  ch.add("first command");
  ch.add("second command");

  // userDraft is the text in the CommandBox.
  String userDraft = "draft command";

  userDraft = ch.prevCommand(userDraft); // userDraft becomes "second command".
  userDraft = ch.prevCommand(userDraft); // userDraft becomes "first command".
  userDraft = ch.nextCommand(userDraft); // userDraft becomes "second command".
  userDraft = ch.nextCommand(userDraft); // userDraft becomes "draft command".
  ```

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](http://github.com/AY2526S2-CS2103T-T12-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">

>❗**Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.

</div>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2526S2-CS2103T-T12-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" /> <img src="images/CloserModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component:

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object)
and all `Meeting` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueMeetingList` object).

* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.

* stores the currently 'selected' `Meeting` objects as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Meeting>`that can be 'observed'.

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.

* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2526S2-CS2103T-T12-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component:
* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`).

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Adding a person: `add`

The `add` command is used to insert a new person into the contacts list. The name field (`n/NAME`) must always be provided,
while at least one contact detail — either phone (`p/PHONE`) or email (`e/EMAIL`)—is required. Tags (`t/TAG`) are optional.

Input processing is performed by `AddCommandParser`, which tokenizes the user input and ensures that the following conditions are met:

- Name is present
- At least one of phone or email is provided
- Required prefixes (e.g. `n/`, `p/`, `e/`, `t/`) are valid
- Preamble is empty
- All field values are valid

If any of these checks fail, a `ParseException` is thrown.

Once the input is successfully parsed, a `Person` object is instantiated. As part of its construction, a `PersonId` is generated automatically, ensuring that each person has a unique identifier.

When the command is executed, `AddCommand` invokes `Model#hasPerson(Person)` to determine if the person already exists in the contacts list.
A duplicate is defined as a person with the same name, and either the same phone number or the same email as an existing entry.

If the person is not a duplicate, the person is added via `Model#addPerson(Person)` and a `CommandResult` is returned.

Otherwise, a `CommandException` is thrown.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

The following sequence diagram and activity diagram illustrate the flow of parsing and execution for the `add` command.
![Sequence diagram of add](images/AddSequenceDiagram.png)

![Activity diagram of add](images/AddCommandActivityDiagram.png)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Editing a person: `edit`
The `edit` command is used to edit an existing person in the contacts list. The user specifies the index of the person to edit, together with one or more fields to be updated.

Any field of a person can be modified using `edit` -- `n/NAME`, `p/PHONE`, `e/EMAIL@EMAIL.COM`, `t/TAG`.

Using edit with tags (`t/TAG`) will replace all existing tags with the new tags specified in the command. This means that all previous tags will be wiped unless they are listed out while using edit.

The edit person feature is implemented using the following main components:
* `EditCommand`
* `EditCommandParser`
* `EditPersonDescriptor`

When the user enters an edit command, the input is first handled by `AddressBookParser`, which delegates parsing to `EditCommandParser`.

`EditCommandParser` parses:
* the target index of the person to be edited
* the fields the user wants to modify

The parsed values are stored in an `EditPersonDescriptor`, which acts as a container for the optional fields provided by the user. This is necessary because the user may choose to edit only some fields instead of all fields.

After parsing, an `EditCommand` object is created with:

* the target index
* the descriptor containing the edited values

During execution, EditCommand refers to the person at the specified index from the currently displayed person list.
It then creates a new Person with the updated fields from `EditPersonDescriptor`.

Fields not provided by the user remain unchanged.

Finally, the command asks the `Model` to replace the original person with the edited person. The updated person list is then reflected in the UI.


The following sequence diagram illustrates the flow of parsing and execution for the `edit` command.
![Sequence diagram of edit](images/EditCommandSequenceDiagram.png)


### Finding a person: `find`
The find command allows the user to search for persons whose fields match given keywords. In the implementation, there are two types of find operations that reuse the same predicate `find`.

1. Global find
Searches across all supported fields of a person and returns persons where any field matches the given substring

2. Field-specific filtered search
Searches only within specified fields and returns persons whose value in that field matches the given substring in that specific field.

This design allows the system to support both broad and targeted searching while keeping the matching logic reusable.

Examples:

* Global find: `find alex`
* Field-specific find: `find n/alex`
* Field-specific find: `find n/alex e/gmail`

A global find checks whether the substring appears in any searchable field, while a field-specific find restricts the search to the specified field only. Field-specific find will find contacts all within the displayed contact list that matches ANY of the keywords of specified fields.
For example, `find n/alex e/gmail` will find persons named 'alex' AND persons whose emails have a 'gmail' in it.

The find feature is implemented mainly using the following components:

* `FindCommand`
* `FindCommandParser`
* `PersonMatchesKeywordsPredicate`
* `ModelManager`

When the user enters a find command, `AddressBookParser` identifies the command and passes the input to `FindCommandParser`.

`FindCommandParser` determines which type of search the user is performing:

* If the user provides a plain keyword without a prefix, the parser interprets it as a global find.
* If the user provides a prefixed argument such as n/, p/, e/, or another supported prefix, the parser interprets it as a field-specific filtered search.

After parsing, the command creates a `PersonMatchesKeywordsPredicate`. Although both search modes use the same predicate class, the predicate is configured differently depending on the parsed input.

This predicate is then passed into a `FindCommand`, which updates the model’s filtered person list.

The following sequence diagram illustrates the flow of parsing and execution for the global `find` command.
![Sequence diagram of find - logic](images/FindCommandSequenceDiagramLogic.png)
![Sequence diagram of find - model](images/FindCommandSequenceDiagramModel.png)


### Adding a tag: `addtag`

The `addtag` command is used to assign tags into one or more persons in the contacts list.
The index(es) (`INDEX [,INDEX...]`) and tags (`/TAG [/TAG...]`) must always be provided.

Input processing is performed by `AddTagCommandParser`, which tokenizes the user input and ensures that the following conditions are met:

- Preamble contains at least 1 index
- At least 1 tag is included in the command
- All field values are valid

Once the input is successfully parsed, an `AddTagCommand` instance is created with the set of tags to add and the indices of persons to add to.

The command checks the following conditions before continuing:

- If any of the indices are invalid
- If no tags are provided
- If all the tags specified (case-insensitive) already exist on all the people. 

When `AddTagCommand` is executed, for all the persons referred by the indices,
it edits their tags, and calls `Model#setPerson(person, personWithAddedTags)` to edit the address book.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

The following sequence diagram illustrates the flow of parsing and execution for the `addtag` command.

![Sequence diagram of addtag](images/AddTagCommandSequenceDiagram.png)


### Adding a meeting: `addmeet`

The `addmeet` command is used to add a meeting into the address book.
The meeting description (`d/DESCRIPTION`) and date (`dt/DATE`) must always be provided. Participant indices (`[INDEX,...]`) are optional.
The meeting can initially have no participants and edited later using `editmeet`.
For the purpose of a `Meeting`, a "participant" is defined as a `Person` whose ID is included in the `Meeting`.

Input processing is performed by `AddMeetingCommandParser`, which tokenizes the user input and ensures that the following conditions are met:

- Description field exists
- Date field exists
- All field values are valid

Once the input is successfully parsed, an `AddMeetingCommand` instance is created with the set of participant's indices.

Before the meeting is added, `Model#hasMeeting(Meeting)` will be called to ensure that the meeting has not already existed in the address book.
A meeting is considered a duplicate if it has the same description and date as another meeting.
**Participants alone do not differentiate two meetings**.

When `AddMeetingCommand` is executed, it gets the persons referred by the indices from the `Model`, and adds their IDs into the participant set.
It then calls `Model#addMeeting(Meeting)` to add the meeting to the address book.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

The following sequence diagram illustrates the flow of parsing and execution for the `addmeet` command.

## **Appendix: Effort**

### Overview

This project required a moderate to high level of effort. Compared to AB3, which manages only a single entity type (Person), adding an additional entity type of Meetings
required us to design and integrate a new set of features while ensuring compatibility with the existing system.

### Extending the Architecture

One major challenge was implementing support for multiple entity types within a structure originally designed for only one. This included:
- Designing and implementing a new Meeting entity
- Extending the model, logic, and storage components to support meetings
- Creating a separate UI view for meetings and enabling seamless switching between Contacts and Meetings

### Entity Relationships

Another key challenge was creating references between entities, specifically linking contacts to meetings. Meetings can involve multiple contacts, which required us to:
- Store and manage references to existing Person objects within Meeting objects, and ensure it remains consistent when contacts are edited or deleted
- Adapt the storage layer so that these relationships can be saved and reconstructed accurately from JSON

### Understanding and Adapting AB3

A further difficulty was understanding and adapting the internal architecture of AB3. Much of the effort involved reverse-engineering how entities are handled across layers (Model, Logic, Storage), especially:
- How data is parsed and validated
- How commands interact with the model
- How data is persisted in JSON format

We had to replicate and adapt these mechanisms for the new Meeting entity, including modifying the JSON storage structure (`InternlinkData.json`) to support multiple entity types while maintaining data integrity.


### Conclusion

Overall, while AB3 provided a strong foundation, the effort required to extend it into a multi-entity system with additional UI functionality was considerable. As a team of five, we worked collaboratively to design, implement, and refine the application to the best of our abilities.

## **Appendix: Planned Enhancements**

**Team size: 5**

1. **Allow a user to remove a phone number or email**  
   Currently, the application does not support removing an existing phone number or email address from a contact once the phone number/email address has been added.

   For instance, if a contact is stored with the phone number `91234567` and the email address `johndoe@gmail.com`, there is currently no way to clear either field. Since the application only requires that at least one contact detail be present, this is a limitation of the current `edit` command.

   We propose enhancing the `edit` command to allow users to remove an optional phone number or email address, provided that the edited contact still retains at least one valid contact detail.


2. **Accept 3-16 digits phone numbers, but provide a warning if it is not exactly 8 digits**<br>
   The current phone number validation is overly restrictive, as it only accepts exactly 8-digit numbers and rejects common Singapore phone number formats such as `1234 5678`, `+65 1234 5678`, or `12345678(HP)`.

   Although these inputs are valid in real-world usage and do not affect the core functionality of the application, they are currently disallowed, which reduces usability and makes data entry less intuitive for users.

   We propose to make the parser more flexible by accepting all alphanumerical digits from 3 up to 16 characters in length. However, we will warn users if their phone number input does not contain an exact 8 digit number with the following warning:<br>
   `Phone number detected contains is not exactly 8 digits. Please verify that it is correct.`


3. **Allow flexible digit lengths for `YY-MM-DD` date input**  
   The current system only accepts dates strictly in the `YY-MM-DD` format, which can be inconvenient for users who may omit leading zeros. We plan to relax the input constraints to accept variants of this format while preserving the same year-month-day ordering to avoid ambiguity.

   The following formats will be supported:
   - `YY-M-D` (e.g., `26-4-5`)
   - `YY-M-DD` (e.g., `26-4-14`)
   - `YY-MM-D` (e.g., `26-04-5`)

   All accepted formats will be internally normalized and stored as `YY-MM-DD`.

   This enhancement will be implemented using regex-based validation and parsing logic within the `MeetingDate` class.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

4. **Make `edittag` command throw an error when the old and new tags are identical**  
   The current implementation of the `edittag` command does not treat replacing a tag with the same value as an invalid operation. As a result, if the old and new tags are identical (case-sensitive), the command may proceed without making any actual change, which can be misleading to users.

   We plan to introduce validation logic that detects this no-change case and returns the following error message:  
   `The new tag cannot be the same as the existing tag.`

5. **Make text displayed on the UI wrap properly for long text**  
   The current UI does not handle exceptionally long text such as names gracefully. When a contact name exceeds the available display width, it may be truncated with an ellipsis (`...`) instead of wrapping across multiple lines.

   This reduces readability and may prevent users from viewing the full contact name directly from the GUI.

   We propose refining the UI layout so that long text wraps properly within the available space while preserving alignment and visual consistency.


6. **Improve feedback for success messages across all search commands**  
   The current success message (e.g., “xxx persons/meetings listed!”) for `find`-related commands (e.g., `find`, `findtag`, `findmeet`) does not indicate what filters are being applied on the list.

   As a result, users may misinterpret the output, especially if they are unaware that consecutive filtering operations have been applied.

   We plan to enhance the feedback across all `find` commands to explicitly indicate the active filters. For example:  
   `Note: You are currently working on a filtered list. Active filters: <filter1>, <filter2>.`

   As all predicates for filtering both meetings and contacts can be obtained from `ModelManager`, a shared method can be implemented to retrieve all current predicates and include them in the output message.


7. **Make the `Invalid contact/meeting index` error messages state the indices that are invalid**  
   Currently, when one or more indices are invalid, a generic error message, like the one below, is shown for contacts:  
   `“The person index provided is invalid."` 
   
   A similar message is given for meetings.

   When multiple indices are provided, this does not indicate which specific index caused the failure, requiring users to manually identify the issue.

   We propose enhancing the error message to explicitly identify the invalid index or indices and indicate the valid index range within the displayed list. For example:  
   `Index 5 is out of bounds for the displayed contact list. Valid indices are 1 to 3.`

   This will be implemented as a shared validation method across both contact and meeting commands as the index parsing is shared between commands.


8. **Specify which prefixes are missing in error messages for missing required prefixes**  
   The current implementation returns a generic format-related error message when a required prefix is omitted, which does not clearly indicate which specific input is missing.

   As a result, users may have to infer the cause of the error from the command format.

   We plan to introduce more targeted error reporting so that missing required prefixes are explicitly identified. For example:  
   `Name field is missing. Please use n/ to input a name.`

   This will be implemented centrally through the `ArgumentMultimap` class to ensure consistent handling across all commands.


9. **Improve responsiveness of contacts view layout**  
   The current contacts view does not make efficient use of horizontal screen space on larger window sizes. In fullscreen mode, a significant portion of the right side remains unused.

   We plan to enhance the layout so that when sufficient horizontal space is available, the meetings view is displayed alongside the contacts list instead of requiring users to switch tabs. This removes the need to click the "Go to Meetings" or "Go to Contacts" buttons to swap views and allows both to be viewed simultaneously.


10. **Allow prefix patterns after a space within input values across all commands**  
    Currently, prefix patterns such as `n/` can appear at the start of an input value (e.g., `n/n/me` is accepted as the name `n/me`), but cannot appear later in the same value after a space. This is because any prefix-like pattern after a space is interpreted as the start of a new field.

    This restricts valid inputs such as `n/n/me n/me`, where the intended name is `n/me n/me`, but the second `n/` is parsed as a new prefix.

    We plan to enhance the parser to support escaped prefix patterns within input values. <br>For example: `n/n/me \n/me`

    The parser will treat escaped prefixes as literal text while continuing to recognise regular prefixes.

    This will be implemented centrally within the parsing logic (e.g., `ArgumentMultimap`) to ensure consistent behaviour across all commands.
